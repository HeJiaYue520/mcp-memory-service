"""
Salience scoring for memory retrieval boosting.

Computes a 0.0–1.0 salience score for each memory based on:
    - Emotional magnitude (high-emotion memories are more memorable)
    - Access frequency (frequently retrieved = more important)
    - Explicit importance (user-assigned priority)

Salience acts as a multiplicative boost during retrieval:
    final_score = base_score * (1 + salience_boost_weight * salience)

Design rationale:
    Human memory is biased toward emotional and frequently-accessed content.
    Salience mimics this by promoting important memories without penalizing
    neutral ones (salience of 0.0 means no boost, not a penalty).
